# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Welcome! 👋  
Thank you for considering contributing to the **100 Days of Frontend Coding** challenge. This is primarily a personal learning journey, but contributions are always welcome — whether it’s fixing typos, suggesting improvements, or adding helpful tools.

---

## 🧩 How You Can Contribute

Here are a few ways you can help:

- 💡 Suggest ideas for daily projects or components
- 🛠 Fix bugs or issues (if any arise)
- 📝 Improve documentation (README, comments, structure, etc.)
- 🔧 Share tips or tools that could improve the workflow (e.g., extensions, CLI tools)
- 🧪 Add tests or validations for JavaScript-based challenges (if applicable)

---

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashi-Singh-9/100-days-frontend.git
   cd 100-days-frontend
   ```
3. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Commit your work**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Your description here"
   ```
6. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. **Open a Pull Request** on the original repo

## 📁 Project Structure

Each day lives in its own folder:

```
100-days-frontend/
│
├── 001 Sign Up/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.less 
...
```

If you're adding a new challenge, follow the same structure.  
Make sure compiled CSS files (like `styls.css`) are **not** committed — they should be generated locally by the user.

---

## 🧹 Code Style & Conventions

- Use semantic HTML whenever possible
- Write clean, commented, and readable code
- Use consistent formatting (indentation, casing, etc.)
- Don’t include generated `*.css` files — users will compile them using preprocessors

---

## ✅ Before You Submit

- Double-check your code works and compiles correctly
- Ensure your folder follows the existing naming pattern (`day-XX`)
- Include a short `README.md` if you’re submitting a full new challenge/project
- Be respectful and constructive
